# qobuz-player

### High resolution audio player backed by Qobuz

Powered by [Qobuz](https://www.qobuz.com). Requires a paid subscription. This does not allow you to listen for free.

The player includes a terminal ui and a webui. 
The web interface is ideal for a setup with a single board conputer, raspberry pi, connected to the speaker system and controlled with a smartphone or tablet.

## Web UI

The player can start an embedded web interface. This is disabled by default and must be started with the `--web` argument. It also listens on `0.0.0.0:9888` by default,
but an inteface can be specified with the `--interface` argument.

Go to `http://<ip>:9888` to view the UI.

## Credits
Qobuz-player started as a fork of [hifi.rs](https://github.com/iamdb/hifi.rs) but has since diverged. 
Qobuz-player is mainly focused on the setup where a single boatd computer is connected to a speaker system.
