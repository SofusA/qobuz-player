# qobuz-player

## High resolution audio player backed by Qobuz

Powered by [Qobuz](https://www.qobuz.com). Requires a paid subscription. This does not allow you to listen for free.

The player includes a terminal ui, a webui and a RFID player. 
The web interface is ideal for a setup with a single board computer, e.g. Raspberry Pi, connected to the speaker system and controlled with a smartphone or tablet.

## Installation

### Download Release

Download the tar.gz file for your supported OS from the releases page, extract the file and execute `qobuz-player` or copy it to your `$PATH`.

## Get started

Run `qobuz-player --help` or `qobuz-player <subcommand> --help` to see all available options.

To get started:

```shell
qobuz-player config username # enter username at prompt
qobuz-player config password # enter password at prompt

# open player
qobuz-player open

# open player with web ui
qobuz-player --web open
```

## Web UI

The player can start an embedded web interface. This is disabled by default and must be started with the `--web` argument. It also listens on `0.0.0.0:9888` by default,
but an inteface can be specified with the `--interface` argument.

Go to `http://<ip>:9888` to view the UI.
